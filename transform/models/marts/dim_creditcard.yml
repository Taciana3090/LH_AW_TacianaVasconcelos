      This model contains information about credit card transactions. It includes 
      the sales order ID, customer ID, sales person ID, credit card ID, card type, 
      and the expiration date of the credit card. It generates a surrogate key for 
      the credit card using a combination of credit card IDs from both sales orders 
      and the credit card details tables. Only the first row per credit card is selected.
